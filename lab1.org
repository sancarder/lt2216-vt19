#+TITLE: Lab 1. Building a simple dialog system in VoiceXML

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
This version is preliminary and subject to change
#+END_EXAMPLE
* Preparatory tasks
1. Make sure that your SIP phone works fine (see README)
2. Fork this repository
3. Clone your own repository (forked): a) to your local machine b) to the server
4. Run flask application on the server (change the port to any number
   in the range 8000--8098)
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run --port 8099
   #+END_SRC
5. Create a new VXML application in Prophecy commander with your gus-name.
   - Set the address to =your-gus-name= and URL to http://127.0.0.1:8099/lab1 (change the port)
6. You can access your application via SIP: your-gus-name@eduserv.flov.gu.se
  
* Flight booking state machine
[[./Figures/sm_lab2.png]]

* Assignment
To make the assignment somewhat easier for you, and more importantly
to push you in the right direction, I have prepared a script that
implements three of the states in the state machine above. Here –
=./vxml-server/templates/lab1.xml= study it, run it, and make sure you
understand what is going on.

- for G :: do either parts A+B or A+C
- for VG :: do all three parts

** Part A
1. Complete the implementation of the flight booking dialog
   system. You need to add VoiceXML markup corresponding to the
   remaining states. Note: you don't need to write the complete
   grammar for dates (e.g. just use the weekdays), you will focus on
   more sophisticated grammars in the following assignment.
2. The error handling for the noinput and nomatch events can be
   improved. In particular, it may be a good idea to tailor the error
   messages to the questions being asked. For example, if the user
   says "Berlin" in response to the question "Where are you going?",
   it may be a good idea to give negative but constructive feedback
   and say something like "I did not understand. You can say London,
   Paris or New York.". Implementation tip: Use =<noinput>= and =<nomatch>=
   event handlers as children of the =<field>= elements.
3. One error that may arise is if someone tries to book a trip from
   (say) London to London. In such cases, we may want the system to
   say something like "The city that you are leaving and the city that
   you are going to must be different". Implement this.
4. By default, it takes 5 seconds in between the question and the
   triggering of the noinput event if the user remains silent. Change
   the timeout for at least one question.
5. Barging in is enabled by default. Read about the =<prompt>=-element's
   bargein attribute, and disable it for at least one question.
6. Extend the design of the dialog system with a "welcome menu" that
   allows a user to choose between booking a flight and getting
   information about delayed flights. Use the =<menu>= element to
   implement the welcome menu. (The information about delayed flight
   could be just "All flight are on time.")

** Part B
1. Sometimes it makes a lot of sense to divide the code for the system
   up into different parts. To experiment with this, divide your code
   up into three parts: one document containing the menu, one document
   containing the booking dialog flow, and one document for the
   information about delayed flights.
2. Implement a global start over functionality that allows the user to
   say "start over" at any time during the dialog. As a consequence,
   the dialog should start over, from the menu. Implement it by means
   of the =<link>= element.
3. Implement any other improvement on your choice.


** Part C
1. Dial SIP number: 9990111860@sip.lhr.aspect-cloud.net
2. Test flight booking application in an exhaustive way. Hint: the
   application understands utterances like "I want to go from Paris to
   London on February 19th" and also partial utterances like "I want
   to go from Paris".
3. Write a test report (format of your choice) containing the list of
   errors and limitations, together with instructions how to reproduce
   them and your suggestions.
